Hangman game

this game was made with Javascript. it took some time and I'm not too sure about some of the concepts, but I realize with everything we learn in class a couple of things come from just looking up others. I need to manage my time with these a bit better, but with this homework down I can reflect on what I need to improve on as developer and make the next project easier on myself.
